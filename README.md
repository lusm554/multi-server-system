# FILE SYSTEM 

So, the main purpose of this project is practice to create and deploy API on several servers.

Practice Ideas:
- VPN
- A subnet simulator
- Network load balancing System
- File Transfer Protocol
- data server, like [file-transfer](https://github.com/f1le-transfer) but simpler

And I decided to create a simplified multi-user file system.

# What needs to be improved
- add system for valideation of API keys
- make all operations atomic
